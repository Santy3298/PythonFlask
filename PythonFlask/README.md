# Python withÂ Flask

First, install the Flask package: pip install Flask

Create a new folder and inside your project folder, create a static folder and templates folder.
The static folder will have your CSS and images while templates will hold your HTML files. This is important as initially when I tried working on Flask while having no clue about the directory tree, I was not able to run the file that's when I found out that flask looks for templates for views where the HTML files lie. And api.py is the main file which you will have to run to make your HTML file work!


#### INSTALLATION GUIDE:
open your terminal and

` git clone https://github.com/Santy3298/PythonFlask.git`

`cd flask`

`$ python3 api.py`
